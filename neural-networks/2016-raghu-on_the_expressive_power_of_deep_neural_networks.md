# On the Expressive Power of Deep Neural Networks

https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.05336

## TLDR
Examination of network expressivity
through the introduction of net measures.

## Notes
- "The complexity of the computed function grows exponentially with depth"
- "All weights are not equal (initial layers matter more)"
- _transition_: A change of the activation pattern as input _x_ is perturbed
- _trajectory length_: Measure of how the output changes
  as the input follows a trajectory.
  A count of the transitions along such an input trajectory.
  Trajectory length grows exponentially with network depth
