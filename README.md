# Deep Learning Paper Notes

This repository is a collaborative effort
to summarize and help interpret research papers
vaguely related to deep learning.
Inspired by
[dennybritz/deeplearning-papernotes](https://github.com/dennybritz/deeplearning-papernotes).

Papers are subdivided into entirely arbitrary categories.

### Formatting
I like
[semantic linefeeds](http://rhodesmill.org/brandon/2012/one-sentence-per-line/).
Give it a skim and be convinced.
