# Deep Learning Paper Notes

This repository is a collaborative effort to summarize and help interpret research papers vaguely related to deep learning. Inspired by [dennybritz/deeplearning-papernotes](https://github.com/dennybritz/deeplearning-papernotes).

Papers are subdivided into entirely arbitrary categories.

Anything goes. Have a look at how existing notes are written

### Formatting

I like [semantic linefeeds](http://rhodesmill.org/brandon/2012/one-sentence-per-line/). Give it a skim and be convinced.
